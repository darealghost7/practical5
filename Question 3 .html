<p>Moodle is an online Learning Management System (LMS) enabling educators to create dynamic courses that extend learning, anytime, anywhere. Lecturers use Moodle to provide course materials such as handouts, lecture notes and PowerPoint presentations and may use Moodle in more interactive ways, which will require more input. Activities such as discussion forums, chat rooms, quizzes and assignment drop-boxes are often used.

<h1 style="background-color : red">Library and E-Library</h1>
<p>Higher Education students have the added advantage of accessing e–libraries irrespective of where they are, empowering them to draw from a wider range of research material from all over the world. Products of digital resources have been purchased with the aim to create a modern, accomplished, user-friendly and simple to use electronic library. The Institution has partnered with some of the world’s greatest academic digital publishers such as Elsevier Science Direct, Emerald Group Publishing, Springer Nature, PressReader and WARC Resources to provide free access to a range of e-newspapers, e-magazines, e-books, e-cases and e-journals to its students. The campus library consists not only of prescribed textbooks but also books of many categories such as fiction, non-fiction, reference materials and training collections. Richfield Graduate hosts their Annual Academic Library Conference. The conference is held to create an opportunity for academic book publishers, academics and librarians to engage on significant issues in support of quality library, information services & librarianship nationally.
